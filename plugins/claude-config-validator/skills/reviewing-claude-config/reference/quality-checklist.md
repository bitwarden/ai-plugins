# Quality Checklist

Use this checklist to evaluate Claude configuration quality.

---

## Clarity
- [ ] Instructions are specific and unambiguous
- [ ] Technical terms are defined or demonstrated
- [ ] Steps are clearly sequenced
- [ ] Success criteria are explicit

## Specificity
- [ ] Concrete thresholds provided (not "reasonable")
- [ ] Specific patterns shown (not "follow best practices")
- [ ] Exact files/functions named when relevant
- [ ] Precise requirements stated

## Examples
- [ ] Code examples for patterns to follow
- [ ] Before/after demonstrations
- [ ] Sample outputs showing expected format
- [ ] Anti-patterns illustrated

## Emphasis
- [ ] Bold for critical requirements
- [ ] Code formatting for technical terms
- [ ] Headers organize content logically
- [ ] Lists break down complexity

## Structure
- [ ] Logical flow (purpose → approach → details → examples)
- [ ] Progressive disclosure implemented
- [ ] Clear routing between files
- [ ] Appropriate depth at each level

## Context
- [ ] Necessary background provided
- [ ] Rationale explained (why it matters)
- [ ] No information overload
- [ ] Relevant research cited when applicable

## Actionability
- [ ] Specific fixes provided, not just problem identification
- [ ] Clear next steps outlined
- [ ] Decision criteria explicit
- [ ] Commands/code ready to use

## Structured Thinking
- [ ] `<thinking>` blocks before major decisions
- [ ] Key questions posed
- [ ] Systematic approach modeled
