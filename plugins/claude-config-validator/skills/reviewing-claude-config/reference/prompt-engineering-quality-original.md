# Prompt Engineering Quality Criteria

Quality standards for Claude configuration files based on prompt engineering best practices.

---

## Core Quality Principles

1. **Clarity** - Instructions are specific and unambiguous
2. **Specificity** - Concrete details over vague guidance
3. **Examples** - Show, don't just tell
4. **Emphasis** - Proper formatting highlights critical information
5. **Structure** - Logical organization aids comprehension
6. **Context** - Provide necessary background without overload
7. **Actionability** - Clear what to do, not just what's wrong
