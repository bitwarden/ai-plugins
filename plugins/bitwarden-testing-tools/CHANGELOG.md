and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- `reading-mailcatcher-api`, reading Bitwarden emails through the Mailcatcher REST API for verification links, magic links, and tokens, directly invocable outside a test run. Includes a trigger eval recorded as an on-demand prose reading.
- `using-stripe-cli`, read-only Stripe test-mode data queries plus the single permitted write of advancing an already-attached test clock, through the `stripe_cli.py` wrapper. Includes a trigger eval and advice-only behavior evals, both recorded as on-demand prose readings.
- `scripts/eval_harness.py`, a shared trigger-eval runner that per-skill eval scripts configure rather than copy.
- `--mailcatcher-url` and `--allowed-host` flags on `read_mailcatcher.py`, so the base-URL and allowlist overrides can be passed inside the granted `script *` argv shape instead of as a leading env assignment that would prompt on every run.

### Fixed

- Addressed the PR #209 validation review before merge: made the `email-patterns.md` command paths self-substituting (the `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` placeholder is not expanded in a reference file), enumerated the covered email types and surfaced the `get_admin_email.py` helper in `reading-mailcatcher-api`, documented the generic Stripe CLI failure exit code and reframed the eight-day dunning note in `using-stripe-cli`, made per-skill eval runners stop reporting a misleading pass/fail exit status, added `stripe`/`billing`/`email`/`mailcatcher` marketplace keywords, and corrected assorted path, quoting, and documentation details.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- `writing-manual-test-cases` skill: authors new manual Gherkin test cases from a Jira ticket, PR, or feature description and delivers a paired `.txt` and Testmo-importable `.csv` under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/writing-manual-test-cases/`, keeping generated files out of the repo under test so they cannot be committed by accident. Ported from the `bitwarden/test` repository so it is available org-wide rather than only to that repo's contributors. See the plugin README for details.

### Changed

- Ported skill standardizes the Automation Type for `Functional` cases on `Not Automating`. The original skill named both `None` and `Not Automating` in different sections, which produced inconsistent CSV exports between runs.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- Initial release of the `bitwarden-testing-tools` plugin.
- `assessing-test-coverage` skill: an evidence-grounded inventory of what a change is already tested by. See the plugin README for details.
