# Changelog

All notable changes to the Bitwarden Testing Tools Plugin will be documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- `exploring-application-context`, exploring the clients and server repositories to build a state-centric Application Context with a `## States` section of real-user-reachable UI conditions and their verification points, and a `## Flows` section of the sequences that transition between them.
- `determining-required-services`, resolving the union of route-based and file-path-based service dependencies from the Application Context and the branch diff, returning service names with URLs and ports.
- Three planning-phase agents: `context-gatherer`, which acquires the feature source; `code-explorer`, which produces the Application Context; and `service-mapper`, which produces the service list. Each returns its artifact as its response for the orchestrator to persist.
- Behavior evals for `exploring-application-context`, five advice-only cases. The with-skill versus without-skill baseline is recorded in a later pass.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-31

### Added

- `reading-mailcatcher-api`, reading Bitwarden emails through the Mailcatcher REST API for verification links, magic links, and tokens, directly invocable outside a test run. Includes a trigger eval recorded as an on-demand prose reading.
- `using-stripe-cli`, read-only Stripe test-mode data queries plus the single permitted write of advancing an already-attached test clock, through the `stripe_cli.py` wrapper. Includes a trigger eval and advice-only behavior evals, both recorded as on-demand prose readings.
- `scripts/eval_harness.py`, a shared trigger-eval runner that per-skill eval scripts configure rather than copy.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- `writing-manual-test-cases` skill: authors new manual Gherkin test cases from a Jira ticket, PR, or feature description and delivers a paired `.txt` and Testmo-importable `.csv` under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/writing-manual-test-cases/`, keeping generated files out of the repo under test so they cannot be committed by accident. Ported from the `bitwarden/test` repository so it is available org-wide rather than only to that repo's contributors. See the plugin README for details.

### Changed

- Ported skill standardizes the Automation Type for `Functional` cases on `Not Automating`. The original skill named both `None` and `Not Automating` in different sections, which produced inconsistent CSV exports between runs.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- Initial release of the `bitwarden-testing-tools` plugin.
- `assessing-test-coverage` skill: an evidence-grounded inventory of what a change is already tested by. See the plugin README for details.
