Enhance the existing CLAUDE.md file with Bitwarden's standardized template format.

**Prerequisites**: This command expects a CLAUDE.md file to already exist in the repository root (typically generated by Anthropic's `/init` command).

**Instructions:**

1. **Read Existing CLAUDE.md**: First, read the current CLAUDE.md file to understand what has already been documented about the project.

2. **Supplementary Research**: Perform additional codebase analysis to fill gaps and gather information for Bitwarden's extended sections:
   - Examine security-related code, authentication flows, and authorization patterns
   - Identify anti-patterns, common mistakes, or areas of technical debt
   - Review data models, database schemas, and API contracts
   - Look for configuration management, environment variables, and secrets handling
   - Find testing patterns, utilities, and coverage expectations
   - Analyze build, deployment, and CI/CD pipelines
   - Identify common issues and debugging approaches
   - Identify external documentation sources and authoritative references

3. **Enhance CLAUDE.md**: Restructure the file to use **exactly** the following sections.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- The final CLAUDE.md MUST use these exact headings verbatim - no other top-level headings are allowed
- ALL content from the original CLAUDE.md MUST be incorporated into one of these sections - do not remove any information
- Reorganize and merge existing content into the appropriate sections below
- Add new information from your supplementary research to fill gaps

---

**Required Sections (use these exact headings):**

Example:
    Client Request
         ↓
    Entry Point (index.ts)
         ↓
    ┌─────────────┬─────────────┐
    │  Handler A  │  Handler B  │
    │      ↓     │      ↓     │
    │  Service A  │  Service B  │
    └─────────────┴─────────────┘
```

### Code Organization

```

## Development Guide

### Adding New [Primary Entity]

Step-by-step checklist for the most common development task.

**1. Define the Schema** (`src/schemas/[domain].ts`)
```typescript
// Template code
```

**2. Define the [Entity]** (`src/[entities]/[domain].ts`)
```typescript
// Template code
```

**3. Implement the Handler** (`src/handlers/[domain].ts`)
```typescript
// Template code
```

**4. Register the Handler** (`src/index.ts`)
```typescript
// Where and how to register
```

**5. Write Tests** (`tests/[domain].spec.ts`)
```typescript
// Test template
```

**6. Update Documentation**
- Files that may need updates

### Common Patterns

#### [Pattern Category 1] (e.g., Request Handling)

```typescript
// Code example with comments explaining key parts
```

#### [Pattern Category 2] (e.g., Error Handling)

```typescript
// Code example with comments explaining key parts
```

#### Response Formatting

```typescript
// Standard response structure
return {
  // ...
};
```

---

## Data Models

### Core Types

```typescript
// Key interfaces and types used throughout the project
interface ExampleModel {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  // ...
}
```

### Validation Schemas

```typescript
// Zod schemas or similar validation definitions
const exampleSchema = z.object({
  // ...
});
```

---

## Security & Configuration

### Security Rules

**MANDATORY - These rules have no exceptions:**

1. **Rule One**: Explanation and rationale
2. **Rule Two**: Explanation and rationale
3. **Rule Three**: Explanation and rationale

### Security Functions

| Function | Purpose | Usage |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `functionName()` | What it does | When to use it |

### Environment Configuration

| Variable | Required | Description | Example |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `VAR_NAME` | Yes/No | What it configures | `example-value` |

### Authentication & Authorization

- How authentication works
- Required credentials/tokens
- Token lifecycle management

## Testing

### Test Structure

```
tests/
├── unit/              # Unit tests
├── integration/       # Integration tests
└── fixtures/          # Test data
```

### Writing Tests

**Unit Test Template**:
```typescript
describe('[Feature]', () => {
  it('should [expected behavior]', () => {
    // Arrange
    // Act
    // Assert
  });
});
```

**Integration Test Template**:
```typescript
describe('[Feature] Integration', () => {
  // Setup/teardown
  // Test cases
});
```

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test              # Run all tests
npm run test:watch    # Watch mode
npm test -- [file]    # Run specific file
```

### Test Environment

- Required mocks
- Environment variable setup
- Test data location

---

## Code Style & Standards

### Formatting
- Tool used (Prettier, etc.)
- Key configuration

### Naming Conventions
- `camelCase` for: variables, functions
- `PascalCase` for: types, interfaces, classes
- `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for: constants

### Imports
- Ordering rules
- Extension requirements (e.g., `.js` for ES modules)

### Comments
- When to use JSDoc
- When to use inline comments

### Pre-commit Hooks
- What runs automatically
- Manual checks to run

---

## Anti-Patterns

### DO

- ✅ Use [pattern] for [situation]
- ✅ Always validate inputs before processing
- ✅ Follow the established patterns in this document
- ✅ Write tests for new functionality
- ✅ Handle errors gracefully
- ✅ Use TypeScript strict mode

### DON'T

- ❌ Skip input validation
- ❌ Use `any` types
- ❌ Hardcode credentials or secrets
- ❌ Ignore error responses
- ❌ Commit sensitive data
- ❌ Bypass security functions
- ❌ [Project-specific anti-pattern]

---

## Deployment

### Building

```bash
npm run build
```

### Versioning

Follow semantic versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- `MAJOR`: Breaking changes
- `MINOR`: New features (backwards compatible)
- `PATCH`: Bug fixes

### Publishing

```bash
# Steps to publish
```

**Enhancement Guidelines:**
- **No information loss**: Every piece of content from the original CLAUDE.md must appear in the final output, incorporated into the appropriate section
- **Strict heading structure**: Only the headings above are permitted as top-level sections (## level) - merge any other headings as subsections (### level) or bullet points within the appropriate section
- **Fill gaps**: Add information for any sections that are missing or incomplete based on your supplementary research
- **Be specific**: Include concrete examples, file paths, and code references from this codebase
- **Include code templates**: Provide canonical code examples that can be copied and adapted
- **Use visual structure**: Include ASCII diagrams, tables, and directory trees where they aid comprehension
- **Prioritize security**: Pay special attention to authentication, authorization, and data protection patterns
- **Stay current**: Reference actual patterns found in the code, not assumptions

**Content Quality Standards:**
- Every section should have substantive, codebase-specific content
- Avoid generic advice that could apply to any project
- Include file paths and specific examples (e.g., "See `src/auth/guards/` for authentication guards")
- Use tables for structured data (env vars, security functions)
- Use emoji indicators (✅/❌) for DO/DON'T lists
- Note any deviations from standard practices and why they exist

**Handling Optional Sections:**
- If a section is not applicable to this project (e.g., "Deployment" for a library), include the heading with a brief note: "Not applicable - this is a library consumed as a dependency."
- Never omit a required heading entirely

**Final Step**: After enhancing CLAUDE.md, provide a detailed summary of what was added or changed compared to the original file.
